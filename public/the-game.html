		<h1>What is <span class="game">The Game</span>?</h1>
		<p><span class="game">The Game</span> is pretty simple, it's a mind game with a few rules</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The goal is to not think about <span class="game">The Game</span></li>
			<li>If you remember <span class="game">The Game</span>, you lose</li>
			<li>When you lose, you have to announce <em>"I lost <span class="game">The Game</span>"</em> out loud (or whatever other way is convenient)</li>
			<li>You can't lose again for 30 minutes after remembering <span class="game">The Game</span></li>
		</ul>
		<p>PS. You're now playing, welcome to <span class="game">The Game</span>.</p>
